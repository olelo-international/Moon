<center><a href="http://olelointernational.meteorapp.com/#/"><b>ʻŌlelo International</b></a> is a networking app for University of Hawai'i at Manoa students taking language courses.</center>

## Landing Page
When you first open up the application, you will see the landing page which invites users to join ʻŌlelo International. The user may sign in or sign up by clicking on the 'Login' icon at the top right corner of the page.

## Register
If the user doesn't yet have an account, they can register with their UH System username and password, along with some information about the language course they're taking, if they're a student or faculty memeber, etc.

## User Home Page
When the user logs in, they will see a page similar to the landing page but has a link to the Langauge Forums in the NavBar.

## Language Forums Page
Originally we decided that we would create a dropdown for "Language Forums" where the user would be able to select the specific langauge forum that they are taking corresponding courses in. However, since UH Manoa offers many language courses, the dropdown would likely be very lengthy and look messy. So instead we decided to have a Lanuage Forums page that contains links to each of the language forums.

## Language Pages
Separate pages for each language (i.e. Japanese, Korean). Pages will be forum style. Posts are sorted from newest (left) to oldest (right).

Users can make a post (i.e. asking if someone wants to meet up). Other users can comment on that post.

The user will get a notification if their post was added successfully.
